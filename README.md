# WishingList
This project is written by Java and designed as a local app for recording your wishes. I made it for personal use, as I indeed have a lot to realize.. Another reason is I need a project to make me familiarize Java again.. A bad thing is it is not completed yet..

## Advantages
From functional level, it has the following good points:
- Recording your wishes (adding, editing and deleting wishes)
- tracking the wish completion
- .. (will add when I think of..)

## Disadvantages
While, it also has the following imperfect aspects:
- sorry it cannot connect to a database now.
- the background colors make the wish may look wired and ugly sometimes..
- Yes, I forget to give it a alarm feature..
- And any other potential bugs..

## Future improvement
So in the future, I will give it a connection to database, and perfect the color mechanism for different wishes to make it look good. The alarm feature means a reminder fuction, which keeps you updated on your wishes, e.g. remind you if your wish completes. Furthermore, to make it more avaiable on all of the time, it may need to be redesigned to live on Internet as a web application so that it can send emails to remind us on the progress of wishes.
